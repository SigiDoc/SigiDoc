EFES: EpiDoc Front-End Services
====

**EFES is envisioned as a delivery, search and browse platform 
that can be set up and customized for an individual EpiDoc 
XML-based project with only minimal training and technical 
skill on the part of a project team.**
The authors of Kiln plan to offer advanced, follow-up training workshops for 
students already familiar with EpiDoc, but lacking further 
technical skills, with a view to empowering them to create and 
manage all stages of their digital publication, from modelling 
to indexing to publishing online.

EFES is a fork of the **Kiln** publication plaform, described 
below.

Kiln
----

Kiln is an open source multi-platform framework for building and deploying
complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML. It brings together
various independent software components into an integrated whole that provides
the infrastructure and base functionality for such sites.

Kiln is developed and maintained by a team at the King's Digital Lab (KDL), Kingâ€™s College London. 
Over the past years and versions, Kiln has been used to generate more than 50 websites
which have very different source materials and customised
functionality. It has been adapted to work on a variety of flavours of
TEI and other XML vocabularies, and has been used to publish data held
in relational databases.
